# HeartClassificationTaskUCL
The goal of this task is to predict whether a person has heart diseases or not.
Heart Disease Prediction UCI

This is the final project which solves a binary classification problem for ROBT 407 class. The goal of this task is to predict whether a person has heart diseases or not. The file, ‘heart.csv’, contains 13 features. The data has already been prepared. Here is the link for the data https://www.kaggle.com/priyanka841/heart-disease-prediction-uci.  

Software package that you will use.
1. PyTorch
2. ScikitLearn
3. Numpy
4. Pandas
5. Matplotlib 

In this task, 4 algorithms have been used: KNN, Logistic Regression, Neural Network, and SVM. For KNN, Logistic Regression, and SVM, Scikit-learn library is applied, while Pytorch is applied for Neural Network. Scikit-learn is probably the most useful library for machine learning in Python. The Matplotlib is used for graphic visualization. 

The sklearn library contains a lot of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction. 
PyTorch is an open source deep learning framework built to be flexible and modular for research, with the stability and support needed for production deployment. PyTorch is an optimized tensor library primarily used for Deep Learning applications using GPUs and CPUs.

One of Matplotlib's most important features is its ability to play well with many operating systems and graphics backends. Matplotlib supports dozens of backends and output types, which means you can count on it to work regardless of which operating system you are using or which output format you wish.

In order to use this code, a Jupyter Notebook is needed, or Google Colab is a good choice as well to run the ‘HeartTask.ipynb’ file. 

Team members - up to three in each team, and their expected contributions.
1. Nurbek Alibekov - selecting the best features, running first learning model
2. Nursaule Erkinkyzy - selecting the best preprocessing, running second learning model
3. Nurzhan Bekzhanov - Implementing a cross validation. running third learning model
